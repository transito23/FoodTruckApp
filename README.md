Description Concept:

I wanted to develop a food truck/food stand app for all local area's. 
In my experience food stands seem hard to come by when you want to try something new or 
end up seeing an interesting food location next to your job, school, or home. These stands seem to always be
in weird locations or show up at the most randoms times around everyone. I wanted my app to include all local food trucks
within your area and show pictures, reviews, location, and hours of operations.

I wanted my app to be able to accomplish where food stand owners/customers
download my app and be able to add their own food truck and display it for other
people who aren't food truck owners to come try out their food. This would advertise
more local food trucks in local areas and help out small business owners.

Here is a video link of a demo of my app.
